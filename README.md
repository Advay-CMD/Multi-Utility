# ðŸš€Introducing Multi-Utility!

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, since you do not know what is Multi-Utility, let me explain that to you.

<br>

## ðŸ¤” What is Multi-Utility and what is this all about? And most importantly why care downloading it?

Multi-Utility, as the name suggests, it is a program that **helps you change programs and settings** in your computer and do a lot of extra stuff that often come in handy one day or the another. It is a **Light-Weight tool** so you don't even have to care about the space it occupies. Nice right? And **why should you download**? As I said, this can come in handy and it is light-weight so, there is **no harm** in keeping this tool. So, be it a IT expert, Bill Gates or any normal user, this tool is **perfect for everyone**.

## Ok, you told me why should I download, tell me what are the features! I can't just download any random application and trust it!!!

Woah! Calm down. Let me explain.
<br>
See the thing is, it is a batch file. You don't trust me then see it's code. You will realise why you should have trusted me.

## Hmm, you have gained my trust, but features and most importantly how to install?

To install this program you will need the .zip file extracted. I hope you know that.
<br>
Now click twice on the program InstallerMultiUtility.bat
<br><br>

<br><br>
Now the app would have been launched... It will check for admin permisions, therefore, if you encounter a UAC(User Account Control) click the "Yes" button.
<br><br>
Make sure to not close the window and remain calm, it will start writing the data.

MD STILL IN PROGRESS
